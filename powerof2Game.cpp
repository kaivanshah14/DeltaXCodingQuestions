// Louise and Richard have developed a numbers game. 
// They pick a number (1 â‰¤ n < 264) and check to see if it is a power of 2. 
// If it is, they divide it by 2. 
// If not, they reduce it by the next lower number which is a power of 2. 
// Whoever reduces the number to 1 wins the game. Louise always starts.

// Given an initial value, determine who wins the game.

// As an example, let the initial value n = 132. 
// It's Louise's turn so she first determines that 132 is not a power of 2. 
// The next lower power of is 128, so she subtracts that from 132 and passes 4 to Richard. 
// 4 is a power of 2, so Richard divides it by 2 and passes 2 to Louise. 
// Likewise, 2 is a power so she divides it by 2 and reaches 1. 
// She wins the game.

// If they initially set counter to 1, Richard wins. 
// Louise cannot make a move so she loses.
